After several years working in Performance Marketing and discovering my passion for data I have decided to expand my career beyond Marketing and focus a bit more on Data Analytics.

Because of this, I have completed a Bootcamp at NeueFische in Data Analytics. In May 2023 I have presented together with 4 classmates our Capstone Project called ["POInterest - London Airbnb Explorer"](https://github.com/AdriDF/My_Projects), a dashboard tool that uses data combined from Airbnb, the Overpass API & Google Maps to filter for and find an optimal selection of Airbnbs for travellers. 

**Skills:** PYTHON  / SQL / TABLEAU 

- 🔭 Currently working on finding the perfect Data job for me :) 
- 🌱  Always learning and improving my coding skills
